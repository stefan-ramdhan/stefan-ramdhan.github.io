During my graduate coursework, I took a course called "Group Theory for Optimization and Machine Learning" taught my Prof. Matthew Giamou at McMaster University. 
I chose to do my final project on Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles using Group Theoretic concepts. Below is my final report.
As is typical of graduate students, I do not have much free time to work on side projects, but I hope to revisit this work in the future beacuse it is of great interest to me.
