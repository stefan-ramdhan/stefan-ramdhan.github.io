This page currently only contains one project from my graduate coursework. My published research can be found on the <a href="/publications/">Publications</a> page.

<h1> Path Planning on SE(2) for Autonomous Vehicles </h1>
During my graduate coursework, I took a course called "Group Theory for Optimization and Machine Learning" taught my Prof. Matthew Giamou at McMaster University. 
I chose to do my final project on Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles using Group Theoretic concepts. Below is my final report.
As is typical of graduate students, I do not have much free time to work on side projects, but I hope to revisit this work in the future beacuse it is of great interest to me.

<h1> Infrastructure-based State Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles </h1>
Another fun course I took during my graduate studies was "Parameter and State Estimation" taught by Prof. Thia Kirubarajan at McMaster University. For my final project I implemented an infrastructure-based state estimation algorithm for autonomous vehicles using Kalman Filters.
The github repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/stefan-ramdhan/vehicle-tracking-estimation/tree/main">here</a>.
