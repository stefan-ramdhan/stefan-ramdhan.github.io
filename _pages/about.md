I am a 2nd year Master of Applied Science (MASc) student at McMaster University, studying Software Engineering. My research is on safety models for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that provide assurance for collision avoidance. I am also interested in verification & validation of AV planning systems.

Having been a research assistant for the past 4 years, I have learned that I want to dedicate my career to advancing science and engineering, particularly in the field of the safety of autonomous mobile robotics. I will be applying for Ph.D. positions to begin in Fall 2026!
