I am a 2nd year Master of Applied Science (MASc) student at McMaster University studying Software Engineering. My research is on the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, I am currently interested in safety frameworks for AVs that provide assurance for collision avoidance. Additionally, I am interested in validating AVs, so we can be confident they are sufficiently safe to operate around human beings.

Having been a research assistant for the past 4 years, I have learned that I want to dedicate my career to advancing science and engineering, particularly in the field of robotics. I will be applying for Ph.D. positions to begin in Fall 2026!
