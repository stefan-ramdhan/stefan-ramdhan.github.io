I am a 2nd year Master of Applied Science (MASc) student at McMaster University studying Software Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Mark Lawford](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/people/lawford) and [Dr. Alan Wassyng](https://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~wassyng/). My research interests are in safe autonomous robot navigation, behaviour specification, and the validation of autonomous robots. Currently, I am working on scenario-based validation for autonomous vehicles (AVs) using formal methods and semantic computer vision. I am also investigating frameworks that provide collision-avoidance guarantees for AVs such as Responsibility Sensitive Safety  (RSS), and others that enable robot behaviour specification, like Rulebooks. My overarching career goal is to enable robots to navigate in unknown and dynamic environments without harming people or property.

Having been a research assistant for the past 4 years, I have come to find great satisfaction in conducting independent research. I will be applying for Ph.D. positions to begin in Fall 2026!
