Another fun course I took during my graduate studies was **"Parameter and State Estimation"** taught by Prof. Thia Kirubarajan at McMaster University.

For my final project I implemented an infrastructure-based state estimation algorithm for autonomous vehicles using Kalman Filters.

The GitHub repository for this project can be found here:
