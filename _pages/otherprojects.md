This page currently only contains two projects from my graduate coursework.
My published research can be found on the [Publications](/publications/) page.

## [Path Planning on SE(2) for Autonomous Vehicles](/otherprojects/path-planning-se2/)

During my graduate coursework, I took a course called "Group Theory for Optimization and Machine Learning" taught by Prof. Matthew Giamou at McMaster University.  
My final project focused on Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles using RRT* and group-theoretic concepts.

## [Infrastructure-based State Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles](/otherprojects/state-estimation/)

For my final project in "Parameter and State Estimation" taught by Prof. Thia Kirubarajan at McMaster University, I implemented an infrastructure-based state estimation algorithm for autonomous vehicles using Kalman Filters.
